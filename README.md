# Elixir Demo Apps

Some simple, self-contained Elixir and OTP demo applications. See READMEs in the individual directories.

These demos require nothing but Elixir itself. For Elixir installation instructions please see
http://elixir-lang.org/install.html. After installation, do not hesitate and start experimenting...

```
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mprymek/ex-demo-apps
$ cd ex-demo-apps/00-hello
$ ./hello.exs
Hello, World!
```
